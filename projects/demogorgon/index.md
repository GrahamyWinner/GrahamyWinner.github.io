## Project 2: Demogorgons in Rowan County

**Project description:** Again, similarly to the Gremlins in Baltimore project, this too was a fun way to put newly practiced and aquired skills to use. The goal of this project was to find out if it was possible that the Demogorgans were back and destroying the farmers pumpkins. There were multiple factors to consider including precipiation and elevation and the location of water. If you click on the link [Demogorgons in Rowan County](../../pdf/demogorgon_overview.pdf), you'll see the various maps highlightling the different factors considered when determing if Demogorgons were the culprits. Some of tools within the ArcGIS Pro software used were Clip, Select by Location/Attribute, Buffer, ModelBuilder, statistical risk analysis, and different feature layers.
