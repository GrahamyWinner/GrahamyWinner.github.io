## Project 1: Gremlins in Baltimore

**Project description:** This was a particularly fun project. As anyone who has seen the Gremlin movies would know, Gremlins being on the loose in real-life would be a disaster. This project made use of the skills that the class had worked with throughout the first half of the semester to highlight where the Gremlins might be or what places they would avoid. Various mapping layers were used along with the many mapping tools required to facilitate the final product you see. Within the ArcGIS Pro software some of tools I used to facilitate my work included Select by Location/Attribute, Clip, and Buffer, to name a few. If you click the link [Gremlins in Baltimore](../../pdf/gremlins_overview.pdf), you will see the entire collection of maps produced for the Gremlins in Baltimore project.
